# sorting-algorithms
sorting algorithms implemented in ruby:
- insertion sort
- merge sort
- quicksort

files:
- sorts.rb: contains the sort algorithms implemented
- timer.rb: taken from RubyWorks
- test_sorts.rb: tests the sorting algorithms and prints the average times (in ms) it takes to run each sort based on input array sizes
